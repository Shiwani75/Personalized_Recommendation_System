# Personalized_Recommendation_System
Description
This project aims to build an algorithm that recommends personalized learning paths for students based on their progress and learning style. By leveraging advanced techniques in recommendation systems, machine learning, educational data mining, and adaptive learning, the system seeks to enhance the educational experience by tailoring content and learning strategies to individual student needs.

# Skills Demonstrated
Recommendation Systems: Techniques for generating personalized recommendations.
Machine Learning: Applying machine learning algorithms to predict and adapt to student needs.
Educational Data Mining: Extracting meaningful patterns from educational data to inform recommendations.
Adaptive Learning: Adjusting learning content and strategies based on student progress and preferences.
Components
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect and preprocess data related to student progress, learning styles, and educational content.

Data Sources: Student performance records, learning management systems (LMS), surveys on learning preferences.
Techniques Used: Data cleaning, normalization, feature extraction, handling missing data.
2. Learning Style Classification
Classify students into different learning styles to tailor recommendations.

Techniques Used: Clustering, classification.
Algorithms Used: K-Means, Decision Trees.
3. Recommendation Algorithm
Develop an algorithm to recommend personalized learning paths.

Techniques Used: Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid approaches.
Libraries/Tools: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn.
4. Adaptive Learning System
Implement an adaptive learning system that adjusts recommendations based on student progress.

Techniques Used: Reinforcement learning, dynamic adjustment of learning materials.
Algorithms Used: Deep Q-Learning (DQN), Contextual Bandits.
5. Evaluation and Validation
Evaluate the performance of the recommendation algorithm using appropriate metrics and validate its effectiveness in real-world educational scenarios.

Metrics Used: Precision, recall, F1-score, student satisfaction.
6. Deployment
Deploy the recommendation system for use in a learning management system (LMS).

# Tools Used: Flask, Docker, cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure).
